	"docker images" command to see a list of all images on your system.
	"docker pull imageName" command to pull latest version of the said image
	"docker run imageName" command where the Docker client finds the image, loads up the container and then runs a command in that container
	"docker ps" command shows you all containers that are currently running.
	"docekr ps -a" command to view all the ran containers
	"docker rm containerId" command to remove the container
	"docker run --help" to see a list of all flags it supports
	"docker container prune" command to automatically deletes the container once it's exited from

Way to Run images for selenium:
First: 
	Using docker networking:
	With this option, the hub and nodes will be created in the same network and they will recognize each 
	other by their container name. A docker network needs to be created as a first step

Second:
	Via docker-compose:
	The most simple way to start a grid is with docker-compose.yaml file that need to be in project root location, 
	and in the same folder run docker-compose up.
	To stop the grid and cleanup the created containers, run docker-compose down.
	
Legacy:
	Using --link
	This option can be used for a single host scenario (hub and nodes running in a single machine), 
	but it is not recommended for longer term usage since this is a docker legacy feature. 
	It could serve you as an option for a proof of concept, and for simplicity it is used in the examples shown from now on.
	To run Selenium Hub on port 4545: 
				docker run -d -p 4545:4444 --name selenium-hub selenium/hub (check the config by launching http://localhost:4545/)
	To run Firefox Node:
				docker run -d -P --link selenium-hub:hub selenium/node-firefox-debug
	To run Chrome Node:
				docker run -d -P --link selenium-hub:hub selenium/node-chrome-debug
	
Test Viewer in Browser:
	Download VNC Viewer from https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/windows/
		When you are prompted for the password it is secret
			For Firefox: 	0.0.0.0:32769 (or localhost:32769)
			For Chrome:		0.0.0.0:32768 (or localhost:32768)

===============================================================================================
The above can be achieved ny using Zelenium  (Zalando and Selenium. )
	Reference:
		https://github.com/zalando/zalenium
		https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEjUCkNft7s&list=PL6flErFppaj1quyeiIF8Rz7nlBPOZTk6d&index=4

	With only single command we can set hub and browser nodes
		docker pull elgalu/selenium
		docker pull dosel/zalenium
	And command to run Zelenium image: (where XxxX is the local port to be used)
		  docker run --rm -ti --name zalenium -p 4547:4444 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v /tmp/videos:/home/seluser/videos \
    --privileged dosel/zalenium start
		
	Thus Zelenium is used for:
		# set selenium hub
		# setting browser node (with latest version only) : grid console: localhost:XxxX/grid/console
		# Test run result :  localhost:XxxX/dashboard
		# create virtual interactive mode as VNC player with localhost console : Live preview: localhost:XxxX/grid/admin/live
		# scale the browser node in runtime (by default latest node of chrome and firefox will be set)
			If number of test or classes are greater than running node
	Limitation:
		# It support latest version of chrome and firefox only
